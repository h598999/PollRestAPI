## Modules

I built a module for listing all the polls and allowing you to enter the voting menu for one
I built a module for creating polls.
I built a module for voting on polls. 

## Polls module

The module for listing all polls turned out fine. It is not live updating so in theory if another user than you adds a poll 
you would have to refresh the page for the new poll to load in. To fix this i think i would have to use websockets and i did
not get the time to implement this.

## Creating a poll module

The module for creating a poll also turned out fine, it has some restrictions i.e you need to have at least two options
to be able to create a poll.

## Voting on a poll module
This module turned out okay. I encountered alot of problems while developing it.
The problems came with live updating when me the current user casted a vote.
I had a hard time getting the table of voteoptions to rerender when the user casted a vote.
I also had to have a restriction so one user could only cast one vote per poll.
I also wanted the current voted voteoption to be lit up green and not have a button for voting
but this was hard to do.e a poll.

The code is in the FrontEnd folder in this repo.
